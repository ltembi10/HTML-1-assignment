Welcome to the Fashionista website. This website is a fashion website
where I will be speaking about how fashion used to be, how it has developed,
and how it has kind of done a full 360. The different trends and types of 
fashion styles will be discussed.

    <h2>My thoughts on fashion</h2>
    <p>
    Fashion is something that has always been there and that will always be 
    there. People are always going to want to dress well, and everyone
    needs clothes to dress up into. I think fashion has somewhat taken
    a full circle because the way people used to dress back in the 90s 
    is the way we have started dressing now again with maybe a bit more
    of a modern style. Fashion always comes back!</p>
