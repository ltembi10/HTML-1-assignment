<h2>My thoughts on fashion</h2>
<!--This paragraph I explain my thoughts on fashion-->
<p>Fashion is something that has always beeen there and that will always be 
    there. People are always going to want to dress well, and everyone
    needs clothes to dress up into. I think fashion has somewhat taken
    a full circle because the way people used to dress back in the 90s, 
    is the way we have started dressing now again with maybe a bit more
    of a modern style. Fashion always comes back!
